# planeWarProject
A simple but pretty complete cocos2d-x network game project for android 

Note:

1.The client is developped and compiled with Android Studio version 3.0.1.

2.The server is developped with node.js and MySQL 5.7.

3.The install file planeWar-release.apk has been installed successfully on android 7.

4.You may need change some codes in planeWarServer.js when using it as a game server and create your own MySQL database.

5.The project is from a new hand for cocos2d-x ,thus,your suggestion is always welcomed.
